Disable test "Active defrag big keys"
This test is occasionally failing on slower build machines with the following:

"!!! WARNING The following tests failed:"
"*** [err]: Active defrag big keys in tests/unit/memefficiency.tcl"
"Expected condition '$max_latency <= 120' to be true (126 <= 120)"
"Expected condition '$max_latency <= 120' to be true (134 <= 120)"

Reading through comments on the following, this appears to be a test issue and not a real product issue.
